# EmoNet: The-Emotion-Detecting-Network-using-CNN

## Abstract 
Emotion detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a machine learning technique that aims to accurately identify the emotions expressed in images or videos. This approach involves training a CNN model using large datasets of labeled images or videos that represent various emotional states, such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise. The model learns to extract relevant features from the input data and classify it into different emotions based on the learned patterns.

To achieve high accuracy in emotion detection, the CNN model typically includes multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. The convolution layers extract features from the input image or video, while the pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the features. The fully connected layers then classify the features into different emotions.

The application of emotion detection using CNN has numerous potential use cases, such as in social media monitoring, market research, and healthcare. It can also enhance human-computer interaction by enabling machines to understand and respond appropriately to human emotions. Overall, emotion detection using CNN has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and improve our overall emotional wellbeing.

## Dataset 
FER-2013 is a dataset of facial expressions, which contains approximately 35,887 labeled facial images with seven different emotional expressions. The seven emotions are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Algorithm 
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), which is a type of deep learning neural network that is widely used for image and video processing tasks, such as object recognition, facial recognition, and emotion detection.

CNNs are inspired by the biological structure of the visual cortex in animals, and they are designed to automatically learn and extract features from images or videos. The key advantage of CNNs over traditional neural networks is their ability to process raw pixel data directly, without the need for manual feature extraction.
